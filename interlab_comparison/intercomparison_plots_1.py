This is the file where I will keep all of my vizualizations for the intercomparison project. My previous file
orgnaization had massive amounts of plots everywhere bogging down the readability. I hope having all the plots in one
place will help.

List of plots that I'll need to make:

a = intercomparison_ttest(ansto['D14C'], rrl['D14C'], 'ANSTO v RRL Test: Tree Rings', 'paired')
b = intercomparison_ttest(sio_nwt3['D14C'], rrl_nwt3['D14C'], 'SIO/LLNL v RRL, NWT3 Intercomparison', 'not-paired')
c = intercomparison_ttest(sio_nwt4['D14C'], rrl_nwt4['D14C'], 'SIO/LLNL v RRL, NWT3 Intercomparison', 'not-paired')
d = intercomparison_ttest(rafter, magallanes, 'Magallanes v RRL Test: Tree Rings', 'paired')
